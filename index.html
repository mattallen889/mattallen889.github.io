            Matthew Allen, pictured left, is an Applied Computing and Informatics student at the 
            University of Nebraska Omaha. He is starting his senior year and will be graduating
            next May. Before becoming an ACMP major, he was a biology student for his first 
            year of University; however, it was not the right choice for him. On top of the 
            ACMP major, he has a business minor. To fullfil the requirements for this minor,
            he studied abroad in Milan, Italy. Throughout this time, he was able to study 
            all throughout Europe and even Africa!
